# Handoff: continue Moran Calendar in this repository

This is the Skylight-inspired calendar project. **It is a Home Assistant TypeScript/Lit
custom card, not a React app and not the Calendar Bridge repository.** Start here even
when the task originated in the separate Home Assistant operations workspace.

## First things to know

- Work on `feature/moran-foundation`. `main` still holds the upstream baseline. Check
  the actual branch and working tree before editing; do not switch or overwrite work blindly.
- Latest development build: `0.25.1-moran.16`, wall Day zoom (D27). The magnifying glass
  opens a 40–96px/hour slider (64 = 100%) without another fixed row. Time/lane anchors
  survive changes; Reset restores configured height and fit. It is session-only, retained
  across views but reset on config/reload; other views and legacy have no slider yet.
  Short Day events use duration-scaled title strips rather than stretching across neighbors.
  Day uses remaining flex height; r13–r15 Timeline/date improvements remain intact.
  Application source `f1a0cdb7c547f93f7bc9c5d6dc551c677c940105` is pushed, remote HEAD
  matched, and hosted CI/Validate both passed; see STATUS for the linked receipt.
  Later docs-only commits retain r16. No main merge, release or HA deployment occurred.
- ENG-05 is repaired in code: `vitest.config.ts` sets Chicago before worker creation.
  `TZ=UTC npm test` passes all 151; no DST assertion or app runtime timezone was changed.
  Do not restore ineffective in-worker timezone hooks. Hosted CI passed; ENG-05 is closed.
- Installed HA version remains `0.25.1-moran.12`, source
  `4b6530ff7e52d800f8a69ea590ef07b0d026d0f1`, deployed 2026-09-21 at 10:28 CDT.
  The r13–r16 presentation changes target the laptop prototype; they are not deployed to HA.
- The handoff milestone `e3b5b7dd38fcc057f5c096643635cb83de139847` and 29 earlier local
  commits were pushed to personal origin on 2026-09-21; remote HEAD was verified.
  No main merge, release or additional HA deployment occurred. Recheck Git for later work.
- Calendar correctness and daily use are proven to the accepted baseline. Five views,
  person routing, full-day pilot, recovery, filters and read-only details work. Final
  visual design and physical wall hardware are not complete. See [STATUS](docs/STATUS.md).
- The latest header says **Moran Calendar**, then current time with a 12px gap. It is one
  48px row with a 40px view capsule. Status tiles start collapsed. The old Today row is
  gone; month/Today/paging share the left-aligned date strip. Do not restore old screenshots.
- The local harness freezes time at February 18, 2026, 3:32 PM. That is intentional.
  A refreshed laptop bundle does not update the separate HA installation.
- GSD is retired. No phase gates, mandated reviewers or repeated “continue?” prompts.
  Complete authorized work, test, document, commit and push verified milestones.
  Calendar writes, a React pivot, main merges and public releases require separate scope.

## Resume in order

1. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [product brief](docs/PRODUCT.md) and current
   [status](docs/STATUS.md). [Decisions](docs/DECISIONS.md) explain the why.
2. Use [DEVELOPMENT](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) to start the synthetic preview and run checks.
   No HA access or real appointments are needed for ordinary feature development.
3. Pick work from [BACKLOG](docs/BACKLOG.md) under the current user request. **CAL-01's
   first Day slice is implemented.** Next candidates are feedback-driven usability across
   views, saved per-device zoom or Timeline/Week density. Those are not already built;
   define their semantics before extending the Day scale. Meals/lists remain deferred.
4. Preserve [architecture invariants](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). For live work, follow
   [OPERATIONS](docs/OPERATIONS.md) and the private workspace's current safety rules.
5. Update the owning docs and this handoff before the next milestone push. Verify the
   remote branch, not just a successful local commit. Keep release/deploy/push states separate.

## Evidence and remaining limits

The r16 local checks pass: 151 unit tests launched from UTC and all 65 browser scenarios,
including seven new density cases with native touch, pointer and keyboard input. Hosted
CI and delivery receipts are in STATUS. Desktop/phone-width zoom was also reviewed
interactively. Actual HA review remains at r12. The user confirmed physical
iPhone HA-app lock/reopen refresh.
They waived the timed provider-edit/cancellation test. Do not reopen that as a gate or
claim measured latency. No real appointment was mutated to test the card.

On the originating checkout, `.planning/debug/wall-menu-clips-narrow.md` was already
untracked. It was left untouched and excluded from this milestone. Its presence does not
mean the old clipping bug is still open; use current tests/status. A fresh clone need not have it.

## Suggested skills

- `build-web-apps:frontend-testing-debugging`: targeted rendered changes and desktop/phone QA.
- `documentation-writer`: maintain the clear separation between setup, reference and rationale.
- `document`: capture durable corrections where the next agent will find them.
- `handoff-mattpocock`: refresh this single current handoff at milestones.

Skills are optional environment capabilities, not repo dependencies. If absent, use the
checked-in commands and procedures. Do not install GSD or block on a missing skill.
